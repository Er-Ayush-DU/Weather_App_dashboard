# Weather Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
Weather Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit-based web app that allows users to visualize and analyze weather data for different cities. The app fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in various forms like temperature trends, humidity trends, and weather descriptions. Users can filter the data based on their preferred date range and city.

## Features
- Enter the name of any city to get weather data.
- Filter the weather data based on a custom date range.
- View temperature trends as a line chart.
- View humidity trends as a line chart.
- View the count of different weather descriptions (like clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.) using a bar chart.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to create the interactive dashboard.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: API used to fetch weather data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
